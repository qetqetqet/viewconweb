        <strong style="font-size: 16px">Device Enrolment Program</strong><br>
        <br>
        The Device Enrolment Program (DEP) is a part of the Apple Deployment Programs (ADP), which help businesses and education institutions easily deploy and configure iOS and OS X devices. DEP provides a fast, streamlined way to deploy organisation-owned iPad and iPhone devices and Mac computers.<br>
        <br>
        <strong style="font-size: 16px">Zero-touch configuration for IT</strong><br>
        <br>
        Get your users up and running quickly without having to physically touch or prep devices. By automating MDM enrolment for large-scale iOS deployments, your users can immediately set up accounts, configure corporate policies and assign apps over the air.<br>
        <br>
        <strong style="font-size: 16px">Wireless setup</strong><br>
        <br>
        Supervision provides a higher level of device management for corporate-owned iOS devices. You can wirelessly enable this mode during setup, allowing additional restrictions such as turning off iMessage or AirDrop. Supervision also gives you additional device configurations and features, such as web content filtering and single-app mode.<br>
        <br>
        <strong style="font-size: 16px">Streamlined setup</strong><br>
        <br>
        The DEP makes it even easier to set up users on iPad and iPhone. After devices are linked with your MDM server, users are guided through the activation process with the built-in Setup Assistant. You can streamline the setup even further for your users by specifying that certain screens be skipped during the initial device setup.<br>
        <br>
        <strong style="font-size: 16px">Mandatory and lockable MDM enrolment</strong><br>
        <br>
        Your iOS devices can be preconfigured to require automatic enrolment in MDM. This ensures that devices are configured based on your organisation’s requirements, and guarantees that all users get those configurations on their devices. You can also lock users’ devices into MDM for ongoing management.<br>
        <br>
        <strong style="font-size: 16px">Volume Purchasing Program</strong><br>
        <br>
        The Volume Purchase Program (VPP) makes it simple to find, buy, and distribute apps and books in bulk for your organisation. Whether your workforce uses iPhone, iPad, or Mac, you can provide great content that’s ready for work with flexible and secure distribution options. And you can get custom B2B apps for iOS that are built uniquely for you by third-party developers and procured privately through the VPP store.<br>
        <br>
        <strong style="font-size: 16px">Get apps and books in bulk</strong><br>
        <br>
        Purchase world-class apps and engaging interactive books in volume, and equip your entire workforce with innovation. Through the VPP store, you can buy apps for both Mac and iOS as well as books from the iBooks Store. You can also get custom-made business-to-business (B2B) apps that are built uniquely for you by third-party developers and procured privately through the VPP store, so your business gets exactly what it needs.<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-size: 16px"><strong>Buy with purchase orders</strong><br>
        </span><br>
        Use a purchase order to buy VPP Credit redeemable on the VPP store. VPP Credit can be procured for a specific dollar amount and is delivered electronically to account administrators. You can buy VPP Credit through your Apple purchasing account or through your Apple Authorised Reseller.<br>
        <br>
        <strong style="font-size: 16px">Streamline distribution</strong><br>
        <br>
        Assign apps and books to users or groups through Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions — giving you complete ownership and control over your content. When apps are no longer needed, they can be reassigned to a different user. Or you can choose to distribute content via redeemable codes, permanently transferring the app or book directly to your users.<br>
