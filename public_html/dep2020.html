    <td height="322" colspan="5" align="center"><p>The Device Enrolment Program (DEP) is a part of the Apple Deployment Programs (ADP), which help businesses and education institutions easily deploy and configure iOS and OS X devices. DEP provides a fast, streamlined way to deploy organisation-owned iPad and iPhone devices and Mac computers.</p>
      <p style="font-family: Gotham, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"><strong>Zero-touch configuration for IT</strong></p>
      <p>Get your users up and running quickly without having to physically touch or prep devices. By automating MDM enrolment for large-scale iOS deployments, your users can immediately set up accounts, configure corporate policies and assign apps over the air.</p>
      <p><strong style="font-size: 16px">Wireless setup</strong></p>
      <p>Supervision provides a higher level of device management for corporate-owned iOS devices. You can wirelessly enable this mode during setup, allowing additional restrictions such as turning off iMessage or AirDrop. Supervision also gives you additional device configurations and features, such as web content filtering and single-app mode.</p>
      <p><strong>Streamlined setup</strong></p>
      <p>The DEP makes it even easier to set up users on iPad and iPhone. After devices are linked with your MDM server, users are guided through the activation process with the built-in Setup Assistant. You can streamline the setup even further for your users by specifying that certain screens be skipped during the initial device setup.</p>
      <p><strong style="font-size: 16px">Mandatory and lockable MDM enrolment</strong></p>
      <p>Your iOS devices can be preconfigured to require automatic enrolment in MDM. This ensures that devices are configured based on your organisation&rsquo;s requirements, and guarantees that all users get those configurations on their devices. You can also lock users&rsquo; devices into MDM for ongoing management.</p>
