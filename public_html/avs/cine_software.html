        Cin&eacute;Acquire is a powerful application that expands the video graphics 
        design capability of any Cin&eacute;Wave-equipped Power Mac G4 by providing 
        direct, frame accurate, machine control for sophisticated video capture 
        and record to tape. Cin&eacute;Acquire works as both a stand-alone application 
        and as a plug-in module for Pinnacle Systems Commotion Pro and Adobe After 
        Effects. Cin&eacute;Acquire allows users to efficiently perform critical 
        tasks such as frame grabs and batch captures with complete RS-422 deck 
        and device control in NTSC/PAL and widely used HD formats. Cin&eacute;Acquire 
        includes support for the 720p High Definition format, FireWire (IEEE 1394) 
        deck and device control, frame capture with timecode, import and export 
        of Final Cut Pro, and tab delimited batch lists and record-to-tape functions. 
        Cin&eacute;Acquire also includes the Pipeline Digital RS-422 Device Control 
        Cable for easy connectivity to VTRs and other external devices.<br>
        <br>
        Cin&eacute;Acquire is now included with all new Cin&eacute;Wave systems 
        and can also be ordered independently from a preferred Pinnacle Systems' 
        Cin&eacute;Wave reseller.<br>
