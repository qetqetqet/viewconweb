        for standard definition, and 4:2:2 HDTV video use. It's so low cost that 
        you can purchase it for standard definition use, and it then has the power 
        to move with you as you transition to HDTV. That's also perfect when moving 
        between standard and high definition work in your facility.<br>
        <br>
        DeckLink HD Pro features 2 channel SDI input and output that automatically 
        switch between HDTV and standard definition SDI modes. This means you 
        can connect to all SDI equpment or digital decks. With dual channel SDI, 
        DeckLink HD Pro can switch into the new Dual Link HD 4:4:4 mode allowing 
        full color resolution, and compatibility with the new Sony SR&#8482; based 
        decks.<br>
        <br>
        Dual Link 4:4:4 video uses 2 HD-SDI channels to carry full color resolution 
        and is incredible quality. Current HDTV and standard definition video 
        formats are 4:2:2 based, so you only get half the color resolution of 
        the original image. When running in Dual Link 4:4:4 the additional color 
        information is carried on the second HD-SDI link, and you get full color 
        resolution of the original film or graphics. That's perfect for critical 
        keying, heavy effects or feature film work.<br>
        <br>
        Also supported in Dual Link 4:4:4 is extra bit depth up to 12 bits per 
        sample, perfect for feature film work! <br>
        <br>
        Combined with this high quality SDI video, DeckLink HD Pro features the 
        best analog monitoring ever designed. DeckLink HD Pro includes full RGB 
        or YUV analog monitoring that instantly switches between standard definition 
        and high definition modes. This means you can reconfigure without changing 
        the connections to your monitoring, and you eliminate the high cost of 
        HD-SDI monitoring inputs for broadcast monitors.<br>

      The most exciting feature of DeckLink Multibridge&#8482; is you can convert 
      between SDI and analog audio and video, as well as analog to SDI, all at 
      the same time. That&iacute;s a perfect solution for connecting analog decks 
      such as Betacam SP&#8482; into SDI based digital systems.<br>
      </font><font size="2"><br>
      DeckLink Multibridge&ocirc; will connect to any equipment in your facility 
      and can be used as a stand alone converter, SDI tethered break out box for 
      editing systems, a high quality 4:4:4 SDI input converter for video monitors, 
      or as a SDI audio embedded or de-embedder. DeckLink Multibridge&#8482; also 
      features huge 64 MB memory buffering allowing conversion from unstable analog 
      video sources such as VHS decks.<br>
      <br>
      DeckLink Multibridge&#8482; makes an ideal break out box for editing and 
      design workstations because it includes all types of connections, and being 
      fully HDTV compatible it will move with you to HD. SDI is the perfect connection

      cable length from your editing station.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>The World's Highest Quality Converter</strong><br>
      With Dual Link HD-SDI 4:4:4 support combined with 14 bit digital to analog 
      conversion there is simply no better quality video converter available. 
      This means you always have the extra quality needed to accurately convert 
      4:4:4 video with true 14 bit precision.<br>
      <br>
      The Dual Link 4:4:4 television standard contains additional color detail 
      on the second HD-SDI link for full RGB color bandwidth, as well as an extra 
      2 bits per color channel of extra precision for true 12 bit SDI. Only DeckLink 
      Multibridge&#8482; has the converter precision to take advantage of 4:4:4 
      quality levels even when working with 12 bit log video.<br>
      <br>
      There is no better quality analog converter available than DeckLink Multibridge!<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Analog and Digital Audio Support</strong><br>

      For analog, an incredible 4 channels in and out of balanced +4dB audio on 
      standard XLR connectors is included as standard.<br>
      <br>
      8 channels of AES/EBU digital audio in and out is also built in on an industry 
      standard multi channel DB-25 connector. Analog or AES/EBU audio can be embedded 
      and de-embedded into any SDI audio group in either HD-SDI or standard definition 
      SDI.<br>
      <br>
      For audio monitoring, DeckLink Multibridge&ocirc; features high quality 
      unbalanced audio outputs on RCA connectors. This lets you use lower cost 
      HiFi equipment for in-suite monitoring.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>USB Control &amp; Firmware Updates</strong><br>
      DeckLink Multibridge&#8482; features digital level adjustments controlled 
      via USB, eliminating level drift common on converters that use mechanical 
      potentiometer adjustments. Using the USB 2.0 connection on the front panel 
      you can change settings and fine tune video levels simply by plugging into 
      the front of the converter.<br>
      <br>
      That&iacute;s perfect if you need to view rack mounted waveform monitors 
      while making adjustments. Software updates are via USB and this lets you 
      easily update your DeckLink Multibridge&#8482; when new features are released.<br>
      <br>

      memory, DeckLink Multibridge&#8482; can be updated for future processing 
      features such as down conversion, title safe markers, logo keying and even 
      video legalization. Check the Blackmagic Design web site for information 
      on supported real time processing features.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Two Great Models</strong><br>
      With two great models to choose from you can get the best solution for your 
      needs. DeckLink Multibridge&#8482; is dual rate and operates in both Standard 
      Definition, and High Definition, while DeckLink Multibridge SD&ocirc; is
