      <font size="2">Professional tape decks such as Sony Betacam SP&#153; are 
      a broadcast industry standard, and now with DeckLink SP, you can work with 
      high quality analog video direct with some of the most powerful editing 
      and design software on the market today. After finishing your work, Betacam 
      SP&#153; masters can be sent direct to broadcast stations or dub shops for 
      duplication. <br>
      <br>
      DeckLink SP includes some of the most advanced analog design techniques 
      available today. The DeckLink SP design team includes some of the world's 
      top analog designers and this means the advanced technology in DeckLink 
      SP gives you much more for a dramatically lower cost. <br>
      <br>
      Other DeckLink SP design innovations include an amazing 6 independent power 
      supplies in a distributed power management system. This means each analog 
      section of DeckLink SP can transport delicate analog signaling without interference 
      from the digital stages in the video signal path.<br>
      Any professional video monitor can be directly connected to Decklink SP's 
      SDI video output, or even the deck itself. The full 10 bit SDI video output 
      can also be used to direct connect to high end decks such as Digital Betacam&#153; 
      for mastering if required. <br>
      <br>
      DeckLink SP also eliminates break out box clutter with our exclusive long 
      7 ft or 2 meter direct-connect break out cable that allows you to plug directly 
      into your deck and monitoring. You don't even need to purchase cables, and 
      if you want to disconnect your system, you only need to unplug a single 
      cable.<br>

      DeckLink Pro allows you to monitor real time effects such as color correction 
      at a very low cost. When a deck is available, simply plug it in, and capture 
      all your video clips, and master out finished work in the most incredible
